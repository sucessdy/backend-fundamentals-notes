Step-by-step: Express setup in an empty folder

1️⃣ Create an empty folder
mkdir my-server
cd my-server

2️⃣ Initialize the project
This creates package.json
npm init -y
✔️ Now your folder officially becomes a Node project

3️⃣ Create server file
You can name it anything, but best practice:
index.js ✅
server.js ✅
touch index.js
This file will contain your Express server code.


4️⃣ Install Express
Express is needed to run the server, so it goes into dependencies
npm install express

✔️ Added to:
node_modules
package.json → dependencies

5️⃣ Install Nodemon
Nodemon is only for development convenience
npm install nodemon --save-dev

✔️ Added to:
devDependencies
Why nodemon is a devDependency (important correction)
Your idea is mostly right, but let me clean the logic 👇

What nodemon does
Watches file changes
Auto-restarts the server
Saves developer time

Correct reason

Nodemon is a devDependency because it is not required in production — it is only a development tool.


Nodemon prevents developers from manually restarting the server again and again.

Typical package.json scripts (BEST PRACTICE 🔥)

Add this:
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js",
  "dev": "nodemon index.js"
}

Run commands
npm run dev    // development
npm start     // production

Final clean explanation (exam / interview ready)

First, initialize the project using npm init -y which creates package.json.
Then create index.js or server.js to write the server code.
Install Express as a dependency because it is required to run the server.
Install Nodemon as a devDependency because it is only used during development to auto-restart the server and save time.

One-line memory lock 🔐

Express → app needs → dependencies
Nodemon → dev comfort → devDependencies
