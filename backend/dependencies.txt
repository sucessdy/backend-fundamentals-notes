SO, the real question is what is the difference btw dependencies vs devDependencies

dependencies
What are they?
Packages that your app needs to RUN in production.
If you remove them → your app will break 😵

Examples
express → server must run
mongoose → database connection
axios → API calls
react (for frontend build output)

Definition
dependencies are packages required for the application to run.




devDependencies
What are they?
Packages used only while developing, not needed after deployment.

If you remove them →
✅ App still runs
❌ Developer experience suffers

Examples
nodemon → auto-restart server
eslint → code quality
prettier → formatting
jest → testing

Definition
devDependencies are packages used only during development.
