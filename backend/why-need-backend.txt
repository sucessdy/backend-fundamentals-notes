// How Backend Actually Works (step-by-step)

// Let’s take a login example.

Step 1: Frontend sends a request

You enter:

email = abc@gmail.com
password = 1234


Frontend sends:

POST /login
{
  email,
  password
}

Step 2: Backend receives the request

Backend:

Reads the request

Understands intent (“login attempt”)

Step 3: Backend applies business logic

It asks:

Does this user exist?

Is the password correct?

Is the account blocked?

Should I create a session/token?

Step 4: Backend talks to the database
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?

Step 5: Backend responds
✅ Login success
OR
❌ Invalid credentials


Frontend never talks directly to the database.
That’s a hard rule.
