So, this folder name should be npm vs npx...(its confuse me a lot)

👉 npm installs packages
👉 npx runs packages

What is npm?
npm = Node Package Manager
What npm does

Downloads packages
Saves them in node_modules
Adds entry in package.json
Think of npm like this 🧠

“I want this tool permanently in my project.”


What is npx?
npx = Node Package eXecute

What npx does
Runs a package without installing it permanently
Uses it once or temporarily
Think of npx like this 🧠

“I just want to use this tool now, not keep it.”



The BIG confusion point (listen carefully 👂)
❌ npm cannot easily run a package that is NOT installed
✅ npx can run a package even if it’s NOT installed


Real-life analogy (this is the key 🔑)
npm = buying a tool 🧰
You buy a hammer and keep it at home.

npx = borrowing a tool 🧰
You borrow a hammer, use it, return it.
