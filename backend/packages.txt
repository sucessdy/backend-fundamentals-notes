What is a package?

A package is reusable code written by someone else (or you) that you can install and use instead of writing everything from scratch.

Think like this 👇
“Someone already solved this problem → packed the solution → shared it → you reuse it”

Examples
express → handles server stuff
react → UI library
lodash → utility functions

So your line:
“A package is a code which other developer wrote for us to use”

✅ Correct, just slightly refine it:
A package is reusable code written by a developer that we can install and use in our project.

What is package.json?
package.json is the identity card of your project 📄

It tells:
What your project is
Which packages it depends on
How to run it
Main things inside package.json
Project name & version
Scripts (start, dev, build)
Dependencies (important 👇)

Example:

{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}

Simple definition
package.json lists which packages your project needs and why.

Your line:
“package.json -> a code where is depends”

🔧 Fixed:
package.json stores project details and the list of dependencies.

What is package-lock.json?
This is where most beginners get confused 😄
Let’s make it crystal clear.
Why it exists

When you install a package, it may depend on other packages, which depend on more packages 😵‍💫
This creates a dependency tree.
package-lock.json:
Locks exact versions
Stores full dependency tree
Makes sure everyone gets the same setup
What it guarantees
Same packages
Same versions
Same behavior
(on your laptop, my laptop, server, CI)

Simple definition
package-lock.json locks the exact versions of all installed packages and their dependencies.

Your line:
“use for all the code and package version and all the package whch is depends or not... install all the info”

🔧 Cleaned version:
package-lock.json stores exact package versions and the full dependency tree to ensure consistent installs.

Quick comparison (very important for exams + interviews)
File	Purpose
package.json	What your project needs
package-lock.json	What was actually installed
One-line memory trick 🧠

package.json → intent

package-lock.json → reality
