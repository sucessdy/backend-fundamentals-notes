What is a Backend (from zero)?

Think of any app or website you use:

Instagram
Amazon
Your college portal
A food delivery app

What you see and click = Frontend
What decides, stores, secures, and computes = Backend

In one line:
Backend is the invisible brain of an application.

It:
Stores data
Applies rules
Talks to databases
Handles users
Protects everything
Responds to requests
